# TotalJSON for Godot

Fast, light-weight JSON for all your needs. Works on all Godot versions with .NET support.

Completely stand-alone, doesn't require other libraries. Nothing but C# for maximum compatibility and portability.

## Features

Does all the basic things:
* Create and modify JSON object
* Parse strings to JSON and turn JSON objects to strings (compact or pretty)
* Serialize objects to JSON and deserialize JSON back to objects

Made with easy usage in mind:
* Complete inline C# documentation of all classes and methods
* Very informative exception messages for easy debugging

Safe:
* JSON objects can be set protected to prevent accidental modifying
* Strongly typed, you can't accidentally read values in wrong format
* Prevents creating circular JSON structures

Going the extra mile:
* Supports all different C# number types, but also numbers of any size outside long/double range
* No limits how deep JSON objects can be
* Debug IDs helps to track down exception sources even when stack trace is not available
* Multiple examples, also real-life data examples
* Keeps key/value pairs of JSON object in order
